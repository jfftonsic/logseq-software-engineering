### WAT?

This is a logseq knowledge base for software engineering topics.

The idea is not to be an extensive detailed drill-down on everything, but to provide easy to digest, highly interconnected, summarized information and sample code for topics.

### [Logseq](logseq.com)

Logseq is an open-source mind-map knowledge base documentation tool, with bidirectional references and lots of features. Other similar tools are: Roam, Remnote, etc.

If you [click here](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/start%20here) you go to a 'getting started' documentation that is itself already a logseq knowledge base runnning.


### How to use it

Clone this repo wherever you want and open the folder on logseq. (preferrably the [desktop app](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/releases))
