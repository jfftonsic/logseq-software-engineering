- Short description
	- In concurrency control of databases, transaction processing (transaction management), and other transactional distributed applications, <span class="hl-neutral-01">is a property of a global schedule of transactions</span>. In this case, the [[global schedule]] is [[Serializable]], while each component database (module) has a [[serializable]] schedule as well.
- A need in [[correctness]] across databases in multi-database systems makes global serializability a major goal for [[global concurrency control]].
