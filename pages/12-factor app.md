- Short description
	- A methodology for building software-as-a-service apps to address issues faced when building software as services.
-
- The apps built using the methodology have the following characteristics
  heading:: true
	- Use declarative formats for setup automation
		- minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
	- Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system
		- offering maximum portability between execution environments;
	- Minimize divergence between development and production
		- enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
	- Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms
		- obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
	- Can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.
-
- The factors
  heading:: true
	- Codebase – One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
	- Dependencies – Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
	- Config – Store config in the environment
	- Backing services – Treat backing services as attached resources
	- Build, release, run – Strictly separate build and run stages
	- Processes – Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
	- Port binding – Export services via port binding
	- Concurrency – Scale out via the process model
	- Disposability – Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
	- Dev/prod parity – Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
	- Logs – Treat logs as event streams
	- Admin processes – Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
