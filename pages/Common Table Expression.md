- The common table expression (CTE) is a temporary named result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. You can also use a CTE in a CREATE a view, as part of the viewâ€™s SELECT query.
- [[CTE]]'s execute within a single transaction
- When you insert a new record with PostgreSQL, you can ask for it right back with returning *.
- If you just want the id, you can add returning id.
- example:
	- ```sql
	  with new_order as(
	    insert into orders(email, total) 
	    values ('rob@bigmachine.io',100.00) 
	    returning *
	  ), new_items as (
	    insert into order_items(order_id, sku, price)
	    select new_order.id, 'imposter-single',30.00
	    from new_order
	    returning *
	  )
	  select * from new_items;
	  ```
