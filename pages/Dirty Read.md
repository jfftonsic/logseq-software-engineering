- A Dirty read is a situation when a transaction reads data that has not yet been committed. For example, Letâ€™s say transaction 1 updates a row and leaves it uncommitted, meanwhile, Transaction 2 reads the updated row. If transaction 1 rolls back the change, transaction 2 will have read data that is considered never to have existed.
