	- Dockerfile
		- entrypoint "similar to CMD, the difference is that it is the main process of your container, if entrypoint dies there is no reason for anything else to exist"
	- Sharing on docker hub
		- your image should have the nomenclature `your-docker-hub-username/image-name:version`
		- you need first to login. `docker login -u your-docker-hub-username`, it will ask Password, but that is not your user password, it is an access token that you should generate on dockerhub account settings -> security.
		- then push. `docker push your-docker-hub-username/image-name:version`
