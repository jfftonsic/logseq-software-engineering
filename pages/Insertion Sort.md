tags:: algorithm, sorting algorithm

- Short description
	- Iterate on array. If the element is smaller than the element on its left, swap them, and keep doing that until the element on the left is smaller than our element. So, there are 2 index holding variables, one for moving through the array and other to perform the exchanges backwards while the element is out of position.
