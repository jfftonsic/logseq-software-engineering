- Streams pipeline
	- source, intermediate operation(s) and a terminal operation.
- Intermediate operations are lazy.
	- they will be invoked only if it is necessary for the terminal operation execution.
- Place intermediate operations which reduce the size of the stream before operations which are applying to each element.
	- skip(), filter(), and distinct() at the top of our stream pipeline.
- Java 8 streams can't be reused.
	- We can only use one terminal operation per stream.
- stream in parallel mode can be converted back to the sequential mode by using sequential()
