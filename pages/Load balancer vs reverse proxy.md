	- Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers. Often, load balancers route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.
	- Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server.
	- Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.
