- older transaction is always given priority
- uses system time to determine the time stamp of the transaction
- most commonly used concurrency protocol.
- manage conflicts as soon as an operation is created.
- advantages
	- Schedules are serializable just like 2PL protocols
	- No waiting for the transaction, which eliminates the possibility of deadlocks!
- disadvantages
	- [[starvation]] is possible if the same transaction is restarted and continually aborted
