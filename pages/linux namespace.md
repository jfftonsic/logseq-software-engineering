-
- Allows
	- process isolation.
	- each container  to have its process tree, mounting points, etc.
- PID namespaces
	- The processes running inside containers can be seen at the host machine but they will have different PIDs when comparing querying it inside the container or at the host machine.
- Net namespace
	- Allows each container to have its network interface and ports.
	- Normally the case: container gets a eth0 and the host a vethxxxx and a docker0
		- docker0: a bridge that allows for communication between containers by package routing.
- Mnt namespace
	- Isolates file systems.
	- Allows containers to be owners of their mounting point and root file system.
- IPC / UTS / User namespaces are other, more hardcore types of isolation that Iâ€™ll not delve into.
