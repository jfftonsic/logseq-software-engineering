- Short description
	- A strategy for increasing [[scalability]] and [[reliability]], and possibly also [[efficiency]], [[fault-tolerance]], [[throughput]].
- It can appear in various contexts, but usually it is related to data-related services, such as databases, queues, etc.
- Types
	- [[master-slave replication]]
	- [[master-master replication]]
- Disadvantages
	- For data storing replication
		- Extra, potentially very high, storage needed.
	- More hardware and additional complexity setting up and maintaining the environment.
	- There is a potential for loss of data
		- if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.
	- Writes are replayed to the read replicas.
		- If there are a lot of writes, the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and can't do as many reads.
	- The more read slaves, the more you have to replicate, which leads to <span class="hl-neutral-01">greater replication lag</span>.
	- On some systems, writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel, whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread.
