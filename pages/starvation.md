- describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress.
- This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads.
- Example
	- suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long time to return.
	- If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the same object will often be blocked.
